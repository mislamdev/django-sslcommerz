## 🚀 Publication Steps

### 1. Pre-Flight Checks

```bash
# Ensure you're on the main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Clean any previous builds
rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info/

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests.py -v

# Check code quality
flake8 sslcommerz/
black --check sslcommerz/
isort --check-only sslcommerz/

# Build documentation
cd docs && sphinx-build -b html . _build/html && cd ..
```

### 2. Update Version

Update version in the following files:
- `sslcommerz/__init__.py`
- `setup.py` (if using)
- `pyproject.toml`
- `docs/conf.py`

```python
# sslcommerz/__init__.py
__version__ = "1.0.0"
```

### 3. Update Changelog

Add release notes to `CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- Initial stable release
- Full SSLCOMMERZ Payment Gateway API v4 integration
- Django 3.2+ and Python 3.8+ support

### Changed
- Improved error handling

### Fixed
- Bug fixes
```

### 4. Build Package

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install --upgrade build twine

# Build the package
python -m build

# Check the built package
twine check dist/*
```

### 5. Test Installation

```bash
# Create a clean virtual environment
python -m venv test_env
source test_env/bin/activate

# Install from the built wheel
pip install dist/django_sslcommerz-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Test import
python -c "import sslcommerz; print(sslcommerz.__version__)"

# Deactivate and remove test environment
deactivate
rm -rf test_env
```

### 6. Upload to Test PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# Upload to Test PyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from Test PyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ django-sslcommerz

# Verify it works
python -c "import sslcommerz; print(sslcommerz.__version__)"
```

### 7. Upload to PyPI

```bash
# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*

# Or use the GitHub Actions workflow (recommended)
# Create a release on GitHub, and it will automatically publish to PyPI
```

### 8. Create GitHub Release

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Or create release via GitHub UI
# This will trigger the CI/CD pipeline to publish to PyPI automatically
```

### 9. Post-Publication

- [ ] Verify package is available on PyPI: `https://pypi.org/project/django-sslcommerz/`
- [ ] Test installation: `pip install django-sslcommerz`
- [ ] Update documentation with PyPI badge

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Package name already exists on PyPI
**Solution:** Choose a different name or contact PyPI support if you own the trademark

### Issue: Build fails with missing files
**Solution:** Check MANIFEST.in and ensure all necessary files are included

### Issue: Import errors after installation
**Solution:** Verify all dependencies are in install_requires

### Issue: twine upload fails
**Solution:** Check your PyPI credentials and API token

### Issue: Documentation not rendering correctly
**Solution:** Test locally with `sphinx-build` before deploying
